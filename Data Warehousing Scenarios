                                                                    SCENARIO 1

Question 1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?

option1 strength and weakness
* More accurate and precise understanding of the fact table.
* Have to add just one column in fact table without altering the rows thus less complexity by adding just one row in dimension.
* Finding the total or most popular instructors would be hard as it would require further segregation.
* Easy to find courses with multiple instructors.

option2 strength and weakness
* Dimension table not required any altering but rows in fact table to be added thus more complex as extra task.
* There would be duplicates of student enrolment ids in the fact table which creates unclean data for rest of the analysis.
* rows with 0.5 enrollemntcount would be easier to find and analyze thus sepearting course with single instructors since its less than 5%.

option3 strength and weakness
* craeting Multiple fact table thus creating confusion and increasing complexity.
* since second fact tables would still have duplicates of student enrollemnts more seggregation would eb required to analyze the data.
* Queries related to other dimensions would be easier to analyze since seperate fact table.
* enrollmentcount would be 1 for all rows thus there could be miscalculations of the data for somone who is analyzing the data without knowing this.

Question 2. Which option would you choose and why?

Third option would be the recommended one as for me it is easier to work with two fact tables and use the one required for analysis without the need of
inclusion of instrucctor dimension. Also this method would get us presize answers without the need of complex sperations of the delimters or inclusion 
of the enrolmentcount column.

Question 3. Would your answer to Question 2 be different if the majority of classes had multiple instructors? How
about if only one or two classes had multiple instructors? (Explain your answer.)

if majority classes had multiple instructors still would recommend option 3 as this option would allow to create two sepearte fact tables use the one
required for analysis without the need of inclusion of instrucctor dimension. This option is less prone to errors if the right table is used for analysis.
