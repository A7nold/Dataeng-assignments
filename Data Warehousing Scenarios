                                                                    SCENARIO 1

Question 1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?

option1 strength and weakness
* More accurate and precise understanding of the fact table.
* Have to add just one column in fact table without altering the rows thus less complexity by adding just one row in dimension.
* Finding the total or most popular instructors would be hard as it would require further segregation.
* Easy to find courses with multiple instructors.

option2 strength and weakness
* Dimension table not required any altering but rows in fact table to be added thus more complex as extra task.
* There would be duplicates of student enrolment ids in the fact table which creates unclean data for rest of the analysis.
* rows with 0.5 enrollemntcount would be easier to find and analyze thus sepearting course with single instructors since its less than 5%.

option3 strength and weakness
* craeting Multiple fact table thus creating confusion and increasing complexity.
* since second fact tables would still have duplicates of student enrollemnts more seggregation would eb required to analyze the data.
* Queries related to other dimensions would be easier to analyze since seperate fact table.
* enrollmentcount would be 1 for all rows thus there could be miscalculations of the data for somone who is analyzing the data without knowing this.

Question 2. Which option would you choose and why?

Third option would be the recommended one as for me it is easier to work with two fact tables and use the one required for analysis without the need of
inclusion of instrucctor dimension. Also this method would get us presize answers without the need of complex sperations of the delimters or inclusion 
of the enrolmentcount column.

Question 3. Would your answer to Question 2 be different if the majority of classes had multiple instructors? How
about if only one or two classes had multiple instructors? (Explain your answer.)

if majority classes had multiple instructors still would recommend option 3 as this option would allow to create two sepearte fact tables use the one
required for analysis without the need of inclusion of instrucctor dimension. This option is less prone to errors if the right table is used for analysis.




                                                                   SCENARIO 2
                                                             
Question 5. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?

option1 strength and weakness
* This option allows for the scores to be stored as attribute of the customer dimension which will make it easy for users to filter or group by scores in
  their queries.
* It also avoids the need gfor additional dimensions or outrigger tables, which may simplify the overall design of the warehouse.
* This option involves overwriting old scores with new scores when they change, which means that the warehouse will not retain a history of chnages to 
  customers scores.
* This makes it difficult for users to understand how and why a customers scores changes overtime

option2 strength and weakness
* This option allows for the retention of a history of changes to customer scores, which may be useful for analysis and understanding how scores changes overtime.
* It also allows for the scores to be stored as attributtes of the customers dimensions, which will make it easy for the users to filter or group by the scores in
  their queries.
* This option requires the creation of a new customer dimension rows each time a score changes, which may increase the complecity and the size of the dimension.
* It may also make it more difficult for the users to identify the current score for a customer, as they will have to determmine which row represents the most
  recent scores.
  
option3 strength and weakness
* This option allows the scores to be stored in a seperate customerscores dimension, which makes it easier for users to filter or group by scores in their queries.
* It also allows the retention of a history of changes to customer scores, as the fact table includes a foreign key to the customerscores dimension rather than the 
  scores themselves.
* This option requires the creation of a seperate Customerscores dimension with 45 rows, which increase the complexity of the warehouse design.
* It also requires the use of the foreign keys in the fact table, which may make it more difficult to perform certain types of analysis.

option4 strength and weakness
* This option allows the scores to be stored in an outrigger table, which makes it easier for the users or group by scores in their queries.
* It also allows for the retention of a history of changes to customer scores, as the customer dimenison includes a foreign key to the outrigger table rather than
  the scores themselves.
* This option requires the use of an outrigger table, which may increase the complexity of teh warehouse design. 
* It alos requires the use of foreign keys in the customer dimension, which may make it more difficult to perform certains types of analysis.

Question 6. Which option would you choose and why?

I would choose option B. This option allows for the retention of a history of changes to customer scores. which may be useful for analysis and understanding how 
scores changes over time. It also allows for the scores to be stored as attributes of Customer dimension, which will make it easy for users to filter and group by 
scores in their queries.

Question 7. Would your answer to Question 6 be different if the number of customers and/or the time interval
between score recalculations was much larger or much smaller? (Explain your answer.)

If the number of customer or the time interval between score recalculations was much larger, i would still choose option B. This option allows for the retention of 
history of changes to customer scores easily, which may be more useful for analysis and understanding how scores change over time when dealing with larger number of 
customers or more ffrequent score recalculations.

Question 8. [OPTIONAL] Can you think of another reasonable alternative design besides Options A, B, C, and D?
If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of your alternative design?

An alternate design that could be considered is to  store the scores in a seperate CustomerScore fact table with a grain of one row per customer.
