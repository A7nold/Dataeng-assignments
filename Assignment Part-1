## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
sol: General purpose because it can be used for a variety of development tasks and not just for specific domain, high level programming as it is object oriented and easily 
readable by humans.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
sol: Python is called dynamically typed language as the variable need not be type mentioned as python automatically detects it.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
sol: Pros:
1) Easy to use 2) Easy to integrate 3) Multi-paradigm approach 4) High library support
Cons:
1) Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++ 2) Absence from mobile computing and browsers

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
sol: 
1) Machine learning 
2) Data Science and data analytics
3) IOT
4) Webdesign and gaming
5) application development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
sol: Variable is a name that is reference to an object once an object is assigned a variable we can access the object using the variable.
example: var = 20, arnold = 24

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
sol: input() function

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
sol: String

Q8. What is type casting?
sol: Type casting means changing the datatype of the variable.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
sol: yes we can more then one input
example : a, b, c = input("Enter a,b and c: ").split(",")

Q10. What are keywords?
sol: Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
sol: no we cannot use keyword as a variable as keywords are already defined terms with pre-determined task or value.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
sol: Indentation is the whitespace used in Python. Indentation is used to create block of statement.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
sol: print() function

Q14. What are operators in Python?
sol: Symbols or keywords used to perform certain operations on values or variable are known as operators.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
sol: / is used for float division and // is used of floor (integer) division.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
sol: print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron") or print("iNeuron"*3)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
sol: num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
     if num%2 == 0:
       print(f"{num} is even")
     else:
       print(f"{num} is odd")
       
Q18. What are boolean operator?
sol: True , False , not , and , or are the only built-in Python Boolean operators.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
sol:
1 or 0 -> 1
0 and 0 -> 0
True and False and True -> False
1 or 0 or 0 -> 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
sol: In large projects we have to control the flow of execution of our program and we want to execute some set of statements only if the given condition is satisfied, 
     and a different set of statements when itâ€™s not satisfied.
     
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
sol: if = first condition check for the condition.

elif = if "if" is False then elif's condition is checked.

else = else is checked when all the upper condition fails.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
sol: age = input()
if age >= 18:
  print("I can vote")
else:
  print("I cant't vote")
  
 
Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
sol:
sum=0
for i in numbers:
  if(i/2==0):
   sum = sum + i
  else:
   continue
print(sum)   

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
sol:
x, y, z = input("Enter 3 numbers seprated by comma: ").split(",")
if int(x) > int(y) and int(x) > int(z):
  print(f"{x} is greatest")
elif int(y) > int(z):
  print(f"{y} is greatest")
else:
  print(f"{z} is greatest")
  
Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
sol:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
lst = []
for num in numbers:
  if num > 150:
    if num > 500:
      break
  elif num%5==0:
    lst.append(num) 

print(lst)
